      <div class="col-md-6 news-left">
                <h4>Stone quarrying process line plays an important role in the rapid development of mining machinery</h4>
                <p>A stone quarrying process line is a type of open-pit mine from which rock or mineral ore is extracted. Quarries are generally used for extracting building materials, such as dimension stone, construction aggregate,  sand, and gravel. They are often collocated with concrete and asphalt plants due to the demand for large amounts of aggregate in those materials.</p>
                <p>The demand for quarried aggregates is enormous. Sandstone quarrying and processing plays one important role in the rapid development of mining machinery that can impact the whole progress of national construction. Stone is an essential component used in the construction of homes, factories, schools, hospitals and shopping centers. The demanding for the quarry crusher plant is increasing, which can be applied in the industries of road, railways, airport and port construction, and the basic construction will consume large volumes of aggregates in every form, which even can impact the rural development.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6 news-left">
                <h4>Determination of design and running operation of Stone Quarrying Process Line</h4>
                <p>Although in general a stone quarrying process line is a type of open surface working from which virgin rock or mineral ore are extracted, each quarry plant is very different and will have different types of quarry crusher machine. The design and general running operation of a sandstone quarrying and processing depends on the type of rock being extracted, the general environment surrounding the quarry, the size of the quarry and the geography and geology of the general area.</p>
                <p>The rock arriving at the processing plant has to go through the crushing process in the following process. The specialist quarry crusher machine used will depend on the size of the rocks being crushed and the desired size. The different sized stone is then separated by the use of mining sieve. The stone is then stored in huge stockpiles according to the aggregate, such as rock, sand or gravel. Some of these stockpiles may be so large that they have to be kept outside.</p>

      <h3>Blue Metal Quarry Crusher</h3>
      <p>Blue metal quarry crusher mainly used for various types of stone crushing work, according to the principle of different products and different particle size, but also divided into many models. Blue metal quarry crusher machine is widely used in mining, smelting, building materials, highway, railway, water conservancy and chemical industry and many other departments. Commonly used crusher machine include jaw crusher, impact crusher, sand making machine, hydraulic cone crusher, hammer crusher, roller crusher, mobile crusher, etc..</p>
     <p> <img src="../../images/products/quarry-crusher-equipment.jpg" height="267" width="1005" alt="quarry crusher"></p>
      <p>Blue metal quarry crusher is generally processed in larger pieces of material, product size is coarser, usually greater than 8 mm. Its structural feature is that there is a gap between the broken pieces, not to contact each other. The crusher can be divided into coarse crusher, crushing machine and finely crushing machine. General Mills processed material is fine, the particle size of the product is fine, up to 0. 074 mm, even finer. The structural characteristics of the broken parts (or medium) are in contact with each other, the medium used is steel ball, steel rod, gravel or ore block, etc.. But some machinery is at the same time with the role of crushing and grinding, such as the self mill. For 5. 5 x 1. 8 meters from the mill processing ore particle size limit of up to 400 ~ 350 mm.</p>
      <p>Different types of quarry crusher machine working principle is also completely different, with the ring hammer crusher for example: hammer crusher is mainly rely on the impact energy to complete the crushing material. Hammer type crusher is working, the motor drives the rotor to rotate at a high speed, material evenly into the crushing chamber, high-speed rotary hammer impact and shearing tear material caused by the material being broken. At the same time, the material of its own gravity materials from the high-speed rotating hammer rushed to the frame body plate, screen, the lower part of the rotor, with sieve plate, crushing the material less than sieve size fractions discharged through the sieve plate, greater than the pore size of material resistance at sieve plate continue to be a hammer blow and grinding, until the break to required a partical finally through the sieve discharged out of the machine.</p>

              <h4>Quarry crusher machine purchase skills</h4>
              <p>Quarry crusher machine is an important equipment in the mining industry, the performance and price of different  crusher are different. The price of the purchase of quarry crusher equipment is a common concern of the object. Some people think that the high price of  crusher machine is a good mine crusher, this argument is not entirely correct.</p>
              <p>Blue metal quarry crusher of different types according to different purposes of production, such as counter - crusher because of its simple structure broken than large loved by the people, but due to strike back type crushing machine plate hammer and an impact plate wear resistance performance low, so for crushing high hardness materials is very successful, hammer type crusher due to reasons with the hammer in high hardness broken play the huge role. Therefore the quarry crusher and the price is not high, there must be, but according to their own needs mining ore what determines the choice of what kind of crusher can save more time and cost.</p>

              <h4>Sandstone Quarrying And Processing</h4>
              <p>Broken work can be accomplished by different crushing systems. Depending on the nature of the material, the size of the tension, the crushing ratio, the scale of production and the use of the crusher, there may be a variety of different crushing systems.</p>
              <p>The sandstone quarrying snd processing crushing system consists of two aspects: the crushing series and the flow in each stage. The progression of the crushing system depends mainly on the crushing ratio of the material requirements and the type of crusher. When selecting a crusher can meet the crushing ratio and capacity requirements, using a broken system, if the need to use two or three kinds of crusher, a few broken in order to meet the requirements, the secondary or tertiary crushing system.</p>
              <p>The more broken series the more complicated the system is, not only to increase the investment of equipment and civil costs and labor productivity low often high maintenance costs, dust emission. Therefore, we should strive to reduce the broken series. </p>
